Despite ease of use, it has also very advanced features like private messages, groupping, access management, public access etc..\r\n\r\nAfter Quick Start, Take a look [detailed Documentation from wiki](https://github.com/emreakay/CodeIgniter-Aauth/wiki/_pages)  \r\n\r\n### Features \r\n***\r\n* User Management and Operations (login, logout, register, vertification via e-mail, forgoten password, ban management, login ddos protection)\r\n* Group Operations (Creaing, deleting groups, membership management)\r\n* Admin and Public Group support (Public permissions)\r\nPermission Management (creating,deleting permissons, allow, deny groups, public permissions, permission checking)\r\n* Group Permissions \r\n* User Permissions (new)\r\n* User and System Variables (new)\r\n* Login Ddos Protection (new)\r\n* Private Messages (pm between users)\r\n* Error Mesages and Validations\r\n* Langugage and config file support\r\n* Flexible\r\n\r\n### What is new in Version 2\r\n***\r\n* User Permissions\r\n* User and System Variables\r\n* Login Ddos Protection\r\n* Some functions has changed\r\n* Some bugs fixed\r\n\r\n### Migration\r\n***\r\n* if you have been using Version 1 before, take a look at Migration Page\r\n\r\n### Quick Start \r\n***\r\nLet's start :)  \r\nFirstly we will load Aauth Library to system\r\n```php\r\n$this->load->library(\"Aauth\");\r\n```\r\n  \r\nthats OK.  \r\n\r\nNow we will create 2 new users, Ali and John  \r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->create_user('ali@ali.com','alispass','Ali Akay');\r\n$this->aauth->create_user('john@john.com','johnspass','John Button');\r\n```\r\n   \r\nthats it. now we have two users.\r\n\r\nLets Create two group governors and commons :)\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->create_group('governors');\r\n$this->aauth->create_group('commons');\r\n```  \r\n\r\nThen, Lets Create a User with power whic is Obama (having id=12)\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->create_user('obama@usa.gov', 'pass-cia-fbi', 'Barrack Obama');\r\n```  \r\n\r\nok now we have two groups and one user.\r\n\r\nLets create a permissions 'incrase_tax' and 'change_government' \r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->create_perm('increase_tax');\r\n$this->aauth->create_perm('change_government');\r\n```  \r\n\r\nOk, now lets give accesses. logically 'governors' will have 'increase_tax' permission and 'commons' will have 'change_government' access.  \r\nok lets give proper access with _alow_group()_ function\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->allow_group('governors','increase_tax');\r\n$this->aauth->allow_group('commons','change_government');\r\n  \r\n  \r\n$this->aauth->allow_group('commons','increase_tax');\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOps wait a minute.  commons cannot 'increase_tax'. we need to fix it, we will use deny() to take back permission.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->deny('commons','increase_tax');\r\n``` \r\n\r\nObama also can increse tax ha?\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->allow_user(12,'increase_tax');\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\nOk now lets check if commons can 'increase_tax'\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif($this->aauth->is_group_allowed('commons','increase_tax')){\r\n    // i dont think so\r\n} else {\r\n   // do sth in the middle\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nCan Obama increase_tax ? Let's check it.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif($this->aauth->is_allowed(15,'increase_tax')){\r\n    // i guess so\r\n} else {\r\n   // piece of code\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\ni think 'increse_tax' must have never been created. just delete it\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->delete_perm('increase_tax');\r\n``` \r\nnow better.  \r\n  \r\nSo what about public people? (public means not logged users). Can public people travel? Lets assume we have permissions namely 'travel' , of course.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->allow_group('public','travel');\r\n``` \r\n  \r\nSo Admin? what can he do? He can access everthing, You dont need to give permiision ( using allow_group() or allow_user() ) him, he already has.  \r\n  \r\nWhat about User Variables?\r\nfor every individual user, variables can be defined as key-value.\r\n\r\nthis is a simple example to set a variable.\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->set_user_var(\"key\",\"value\");\r\n``` \r\n\r\nFor example if you want to keep users phones\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->set_user_var(\"phone\",\"0216 313 23 33\");\r\n``` \r\n\r\nto get the variable\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->set_user_var(\"key\");\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAauth also permits you to define System Variables which can be accesed by every user in the system.\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->set_system_var(\"key\",\"Value\");\r\n$this->aauth->set_system_var(\"key\");\r\n``` \r\n\r\nok lets look at private messages. John (his id=3) will send pm to Ali(id=4)\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->send_pm(3,4,'Hi bro. i need you',' can you gimme your credit card?')\r\n``` \r\n  \r\nsorry John you will be banned :(\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->aauth->ban_user(3);\r\n``` \r\n \r\nQuick Start is done but thats not the end  \r\nTake a look [detailed Documentation from wiki](https://github.com/emreakay/CodeIgniter-Aauth/wiki/_pages)   \r\n\r\nDont forget to watch Aauth.  \r\nYou can also contribute and help me :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
